This version of React includes additional features such as error messages and warnings that can help developers diagnose and fix issues in their code. It also includes additional comments and documentation that can help developers understand how the code works.

React.production.js, on the other hand, is the production version of React, which is intended for use in a live, production environment. This version of React has been minified and optimized for performance, and it does not include the additional features and comments found in the development version. It will be smaller in size than the development version.


Q8.What ia async and defer?

"async" tells the browser to download the script in the background, and then execute it as soon as it is available. This means that the script can be executed while the page continues to load.

"defer" tells the browser to download the script in the background, but to wait to execute it until the page has finished loading. This means that the script will be executed after all the other resources on the page have loaded.
